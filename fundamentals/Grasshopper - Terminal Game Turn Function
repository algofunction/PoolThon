/*Instructions:

Terminal game turn function
You are creating a text-based terminal version of your favorite board game. In the board game, each turn has six steps that must happen in this order: roll the dice, move, combat, get coins, buy more health, and print status.

You are using a library (Game.Logic in C#) that already has the functions below. Create a function named doTurn/DoTurn/do_turn that calls the functions in the proper order as described in the paragraph above.
- `combat`
- `buy_health`
- `get_coins`
- `print_status`
- `roll_dice`
- `move`*/



/*Sample Tests:
test.describe('one turn')
do_turn()
test.it('should call all 6 functions')
test.assert_equals(len(log), 6)*/



//Solution:
def do_turn():
    steps = [roll_dice, move, combat, 
             get_coins, buy_health, print_status]
    
    for step in steps:
        step()
