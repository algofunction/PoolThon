/*Instructions:

You are creating an "Escape the room" game. 
The first step is to create a hash table called rooms that contains all of the rooms of the game. 
There should be at least 3 rooms inside it, 
each being a hash table with at least three properties (e.g. name, description, completed).*/



/*Sample Tests:
@test.describe('room creation')
def example_tests():
    @test.it('should have at least three rooms')
    def example_test_case():
        test.expect(len(rooms) >= 3, 'Should have at least three rooms')
        
    @test.it('each room should be a dictionary')
    def example_test_case():
        for name in rooms.values(): 
            test.expect(isinstance(name, dict), f'{name} should be a dictionary')
        
    @test.it('should contain at least three properties per room')
    def example_test_case():
        for name in rooms.values(): 
            test.expect(len(name) >= 3, f'Not enough properties for room: {name}')*/



//Solution:
room1 = {"name": "", "description": "", "completed": False}
room2 = {"name": "", "description": "", "completed": False}
room3 = {"name": "", "description": "", "completed": False}

rooms = {0: room1, 1: room2, 2: room3}
