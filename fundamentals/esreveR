/*Instructions:
Write a function reverse which reverses a list (or in clojure's case, any list-like data structure)
(the dedicated builtin(s) functionalities are deactivated)*/



/*Sample Tests:
test.assert_equals(reverse(list([1,2,3])), [3,2,1])
test.assert_equals(reverse(list([1,None,14,"two"])), ["two",14,None,1])*/



//Solution:
def reverse(lst):
    out = list()
    for i in range(len(lst)-1,-1,-1):
        out.append(lst[i])
    return out
